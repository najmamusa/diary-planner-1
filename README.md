# Diary Planner

## Description
An application for day planning that includes standard business working sections, a real-time clock, and a save function.

## User Story
As a professional seeking effective time management, I want to use a day scheduler app that provides standard business working blocks, a real-time clock for accurate scheduling, and a save feature to store and retrieve my daily plans effortlessly. This will help me organize and optimize my daily tasks, enhancing productivity and efficiency in my work routine.

## Acceptance Criteria
The app should be as follows:

- When a user opens the planner, show the current day at the top of the calendar.

- When the user scrolls down, timeblocks for regular business hours are shown.

- When a timeblock is being examined, color-code each one according to the past, present, and future.

- When a user clicks a timeblock, allow them to input an event.

- When the save button is hit during that timeblock, the event is saved locally.
